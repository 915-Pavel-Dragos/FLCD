To represent the FA I used a list for the set of states(Q), for the alphabet(Sigma), for the inital state(q0) and for the set 
of final states.

For the set of transitions I used a dictionary, in which the key is a tuple formed by the start state and the value of that state from 
the alphabet and the final state of the transition.

<Transition> ::= "(" <State> "," <Symbol> ")" "->" <State>

<TransitionRules> ::= <Transition> | <Transition> <TransitionRules>

<State> ::= "a" | "b" | "c"

<StateList> ::= <State> | <State> <StateList>

<Symbol> ::= "1" | "2"

<SymbolList> ::= <Symbol> | <Symbol> <SymbolList>

<Automaton> ::= "Q = {" <StateList> "}" 
               "Sigma = {" <SymbolList> "}" 
               "q0 = " <State>
               "F = {" <StateList> "}" 
               "Gamma = {" <TransitionRules> "}"
